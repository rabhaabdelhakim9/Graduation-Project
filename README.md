Graduation Project – Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) 
This project will focus on conducting an end-to-end data analysis process to solve a real business problem.
We will start by collecting and cleaning the data using SQL and Power BI to ensure data quality and consistency. Then, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and key insights.
After that, we will build a structured data model and create DAX measures and KPIs to evaluate business performance. We will analyze customer behavior, performance metrics, and overall trends to extract actionable insights.
Finally, we will design dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven decision-making and help stakeholders make informed business decisions.
